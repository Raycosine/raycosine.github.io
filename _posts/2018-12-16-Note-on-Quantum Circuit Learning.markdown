This is a brief note on quantum circuit learning and following papers:
- [Quantum Circuit Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00745).
- Optimal Quantum Learning of a Unitary Transformation
- Optimal processing of reversible quantum channels

Besides, I also put some basic concepts in this post, such as swap test

Quantum Circuit Learning
===

The framework of quantum circuit learning (QCL) is similar to the classical optimization process: apply a parameterized operation to get an output, use the output to calculate cost function, iteratively lower the cost function and finally evaluate the performance on a test set.

The difference is that QCL encodes input data into quantum states using some initialized qubits \\(\|a\rangle\\) \\(\|0\rangle\\). And output is quantum states generated by applying a parameterized unitary operator to the input states. Then use some Pauli operators \\({B_j}\\)

Swap Test
===
As shown in [this lecture](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.walter/physics491/lecture10.pdf), the swap(fredkin) operator \\(F:\|xy\rangle\mapsto\|yx\rangle\\) is firstly proved to be completely equivalent to performing the projective measurement \\(\\{P_0, P_1\\}\\).
