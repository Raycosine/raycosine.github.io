## Continuous-time quantum walk


### 16.1 Continuous-time quantum walk

> It is easiest to define a quantum analog of a continuous-time random walk

#### Classical continuous-time random walk
Adjacency matrix \\(A\\) & Laplacian \\(L\\): as you know

> The continuous-time random walk on G is defined as the solution of the differential equation
\\(\frac{d}{dt} p_j (t) = \sum_{k\in V} L_{jk} p_k (t)\\)

The evolution for any time \\(t\\) is a *stochastic processes* (normalization preserved) since the columns of L sum to \\(0\\).

#### The quantum analog

Compared to the Schrodinger equation:
\\(i\frac{d}{dt}\|\psi\rangle=H\|\psi\rangle\\)

Let \\(q_j(t)=\langle j\|\psi(t)\rangle\\) be quantum amplitudes. The equation is

\\(i\frac{d}{dt}q_j(t)=\sum_{k\in V} L_{jk} q_k(t)\\).

Normalization preserved since Laplacian is Hermitian.

Solution: \\(\|\psi(t)\rangle=e^{-iLt} \|\psi(0)\rangle\\)

Note: Any Hermitian Hamiltonian that represents the structure of \\(G\\) can be used.

### 16.2 Random and quantum walks on the hypercube

The Boolean hypercube: as you know.

<img src="https://github.com/Raycosine/raycosine.github.io/blob/master/_images/hypercube.jpg?raw=true" width="30%" style="margin: auto 0;">

The adjacency matrix is \\(A=\sum_{j=1}^n \sigma_x^{j}\\)

When \\(G\\) is regular, \\(L=A+deg* I\\), the walk generated by \\(L\\) have an overall phase \\(e^{-i\ deg\ t}\\) compared to the one generated by \\(A\\).

The probability of reaching the opposite vertex starting from a vertex is exponentially small at any time, since the walk rapidly (\\(t=\pi/2\\)) reaches the uniform distribution over all vertices.

### 16.3 Random and quantum walks in one dimension

The graph: an infinite path, unweighted

The eigenstates of \\(L\\): momentum states \\(\|\hat{p}\rangle\\) with components \\(\langle j\| \hat{p}\rangle=e^{ipj}\\).

I don't know Bessel function..I like vegetable so much...

The continuous-time classical random walk and the quantum analog have dramatically different behaviors.

### 16.4 Black-box traversal of the glued trees graph

The glued trees graph: two balanced binary trees of height \\(n\\) (should refer to full binary tree, since # vertices is \\(2^{n+1}-1\\)?) joined by a random cycle of length \\(2\times 2^n\\) that alternates between the leaves of the two trees. Denote the trees as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), leaves as \\(L_{Ai}\\) and \\(L_{Bi}\\). The random cycle would be in this form: \\(L_{Ai}, L_{Bj}, L_{Ak}, L_{Bm}, ...\\).

Classical walk: 

hard to reach the root on the opposite side starting from one root.

Quantum walk: 

> produces a state with a overlap lower bounded by \\(1/poly(n)\\) on the other root, in a amount of time upper bounded by \\(poly(n)\\).

### 16.5 Quantum walk algorithm to traverse the glued trees graph

Strategy:

> simply to run the quantum walk and show that the resulting state has a substantial overlap on the \\(EXIT\\) for some \\(t=poly(n)\\).

Definitions:

ENTRANCE / EXIT: the root of the left / right tree.

Basis of states, uniform superpositions over the vertices on the same layer: \\(\|col j\rangle := \frac{!}{\sqrt{N_j}} \sum_{\delta(a, ENTRANCE)=j} \|a\rangle\\). (\\(N_j\\): # of all vertices satisfying \\(\delta(a, ENTRANCE)=j\\))

Easy to find \\(A\|col j\rangle\\).

This walk starting from \\(ENTRANCE\\) is effectively the same as a quantum walk on a weighted path of \\(2n+2\\) (slightly different from 16.3's case)

To prove that this walk reaches the \\(EXIT\\) in poly time, see the notion of *mixing time* of a quantum walk in the next subsection.

### 16.6 Classical and quantum mixing

Informal definition:

> The mixing time of a random walk is the amount of time it takes to come close to a stationary distribution. 

\\(u:=(1,1,...,1)/\|V\|\\) is the eigenvector of \\(L\\) with eigenvalue \\(0\\).


If \\(G\\) is connected, \\(u\\) is the only eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Use the spectral decomposition of \\(L\\). In \\(p(t)\\), terms of eigenvectors with non-zero eigenvalues will decrease exponentially in time and then the walk asymptotically approaches the uniform distribution (\\(u\\)). Hence the inverse of the largest nonzero eigenvalue of \\(L\\) determines the "convergence" speed.

\\(p_{a\rightarrow b} (T)=\sum_\lambda \| \langle a\| \lambda\rangle \langle b\|\lambda \rangle \|^2 + \sum_{\lambda\neq \lambda^\prime} \langle b\|\lambda\rangle \langle \lambda \| a\rangle \langle a\|\lambda^\prime\rangle \langle \lambda^\prime \|b\rangle \frac{1-e^{-i(\lambda-\lambda^\prime)T}}{i(\lambda-\lambda^\prime)T}\\)

Roughly speaking, since we expect \\(\|(\lambda-\lambda^\prime)T\|>>1\\), \\(T>>\frac{1}{\|\lambda-\lambda^\prime\|}\\)

Limiting distribution:

> A Limiting Distribution (also called an asymptotic distribution) is the hypothetical distribution — or convergence — of a sequence of distributions. As it is hypothetical, it isn't a distribution in the general sense of the word. (from [here](https://www.statisticshowto.com/limiting-distribution/#:~:text=A%20Limiting%20Distribution%20(also%20called,general%20sense%20of%20the%20word.))

> Since a quantum walk is a unitary process, we should not expect it to approach a limiting quantum state, no matter how long we wait. Nevertheless, it is possible to deﬁne a notion of the limiting distribution of a quantum walk...

? why does it say that \\(T\\) need to be large compared to the smallest gap between a particular pair of eigenvalues in the classical case? 

"The mixing time of the quantum walk is \\(poly(n)\\)" is proven by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

Formally speaking, the "distance" between the probability of reaching \\(EXIT\\) starting from \\(ENTRANCE\\) within time \\(T\\), \\(p_{ENTRANCE\rightarrow EXIT}(T)\\), and the limiting value \\(p_{ENTRANCE\rightarrow EXIT}(\infty)\\), can be written as:

\\(\|(p_{ENTRANCE\rightarrow EXIT}(\infty)-(p_{ENTRANCE\rightarrow EXIT}(T)\|\leq\frac{2}{\Delta T}\\), where \\(\Delta\\) denotes the smallest gap between any pair of distinct eigenvalues of \\(A\\).

? Why do we need to lower bound \\(\Delta\\)?

#### Understanding the spectrum of A

Recall that for any \\(p\\), the state \\(\|\lambda\rangle\\) with amplitudes \\(\langle col j\|\lambda\rangle = e^{ipj}\\) satisfies \\(\langle col j\|A\|\lambda\rangle =\lambda \langle col j\|\lambda\rangle\\), where \\(\lambda=2\sqrt{2} \cos{p}\\) for all values of \\(j\\) except \\(0,n,n+1,2n+1\\). The eigenvalue condition (\\(\langle col j\|A\|\lambda\rangle =\lambda \langle col j\|\lambda\rangle\\)) for \\(j=0,2n+1, n, n+1\\) can be satisfied by replacing \\(\|\lambda\rangle\\) by linear combination of \\(\{\|\lambda\rangle\}\\) previously used. And then we obtain (16.51)~(16.53).

? Does \\(T=5n/\Delta\\) only apply to the n=4 case?

### 16.7 Classical lower bound

Solving (A or B) is hard --> solving A is hard

? In the first step, is \\(n\\) considered while talking about "exponentially many more possible names" and "exponentially small probability"? The number of possible names seems to be just approximately the square of \\(\|V\|\\).
