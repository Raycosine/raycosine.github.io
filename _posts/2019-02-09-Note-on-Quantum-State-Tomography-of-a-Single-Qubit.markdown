This is a note about [a paper of the same title](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.4759.pdf).

> Quantum state tomography is the attempt to discover the quantum-mechanical state of a physical system, or more precisely, of a finite set of systems prepared by the same process.

> In practice, there are many different mathematical methods for determining a density matrix from a given experimental data set, yielding sometimes very different results, and it is not obvious which of these is objectively better, even when opinions and philosophical arguments are seemingly clear
